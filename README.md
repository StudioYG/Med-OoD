# Med-OoD
Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on limited and imperfect medical datasets. Med-OoD is a data-centric framework that introduces OoD data supervision into the fully-supervised biomedical segmentation to resolve this misclassification bottleneck. Please refer to the paper for more interesting details.
